Hi!

Welcome to my professional portfolio website, I'm ***Kaustubh*** ```(ka-aus-th(ank you)-oob)```. Here, you may find examples on the projects that I've done on my own time, giving you a somewhat minor glimpse into some of the areas I've explored and the DSP analyses I've done.

I'm an expereinced R&D engineer who brings a variety of skills to the table gathered over 4+ years of working in 2 R&D roles. I have formally developed designed and developed 2 Biomedical devices 

- BIOR (Biomedical Indirect Ophthalmoscope for Retinopathy) - confocal opthalmoscopic retinal observing and imaging device
- MR compatible, variable rate Infusion Pump (flow rate down to 0.1 [mL])

and assisted with the development of a focused ultrasound array along the lines of developing DSP algorithms and data pipeline processing automation.

I find it a great pleasure to ```collaborate on multi-disciplinary projects```, I find that ```problem solving and communication are my key skills``` that allows a successful exchange of expectations, ideas and feedback. I'm ```highly organized``` and am ```comfortable with unfamiliarity```. I like clarity on over-arching objectives/ goals and am able to independently navigate through uncertainty. I am able to engage with colleagues based on their personality type and am ```comfortable with taking leadership```. 

Thanks for visiting!
