# Overview

This is my respository whic is currently hosting my [portfolio website][1] using Github pages. 

Currently the website only lists my project portfolio in the form of articles that link back to other repositories with OSS code made available under the CC license.

I have utilized the following tools to creat this website:

* [Building] Jekyll
* [Building, Deploying] Chirpy theme
* [Hosting] Github Pages

If you wish to start a github website using Jekyll, follow the instructions in the [Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to complete the installation of
the basic environment. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) also needs to be installed.

## Usage

Please see the [theme's docs](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy#documentation).
