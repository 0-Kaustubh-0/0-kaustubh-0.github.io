# Overview

This respository is currently hosting my [portfolio website][1] using Github pages. 

At the moment, this website only lists my additonal projects as a portfolio in the form of articles, most of which link back to other repositories with OSS code made available under the CC license under this github account.

I have utilized the following tools to create this website:

* [Building] Jekyll - Ruby based tool
* [Building, Deploying] Chirpy theme
* [Hosting] Github Pages

If you wish to start a github website using Jekyll, follow the instructions in the [Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to complete the installation of the basic environment. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) also needs to be installed.

## Documentation

Please see the [theme's docs](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy#documentation).

## License

The [chirpy][chirpy] theme is published under [MIT][mit] License.
